### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is JosÃ© David GarcÃ­a DÃ­az, I'm 25 years old and I live in Durango, MÃ©xico; but is on my planes to move to CDMX, MÃ©xico.

### Game development.

I like to play videogames and I've been learning how to make them since 2017. I started using the Monogame framework but I switched to Unity, which has become my favorite engine and the one I feel more comfortable working on, but I also tried Godot and Unreal. You can see some of my work in my [Itch](https://salmon64.itch.io/) profile.

#### Project KOE

Project KOE is the most ambicious game I've worked on, is a 2D platformer with gameplay inspired by Super Meat Boy and graphics inspired by Hollow Knight.I making this game and its assets all by myself with the exceptions of the sound effects and music (wich I have license to use  them).

For this I used the following tools:
* Unity 2020.1f
* Krita for draw all the sprites, textures, normal maps and tilesets.
* Sonniss.com - GDC - Game Audio Bundles.
* Audacity for edit some audio effects.
* C#
* Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2019 Community.
* Json.NET

A playable demo is available for Windows and it features: 
* 6 levels which gives the demo an aproximate lenght of 40 minutes.
* It can be played in english or spanish.
* Pulished graphics with some cool shaders and parallax scrolling for sense of depth.
* Sound effects and a music track for the levels.
* Game saves your progress using JSON serialization.
