## Hi there üëã!
My name is Jos√© David Garc√≠a D√≠az, I'm 25 years old and I live in Durango, M√©xico; but is on my plans to move to CDMX, M√©xico since I'm studying computer science in the Universidad Auton√≥ma de M√©xico. I like playing and making games. I spend a lot of time playing with the Unity Engine capacities, imitating mechanics from games that I like or testing things that I would like in a videogame. Lately I've been interested in competitive programming too, is fun and it could help me to improve my algorithms to solve programming problems. I will keep this profile updated as a portfolio with the latest personal projects I've worked on.

## Game development.

I started using the Monogame framework in 2016, but I switched to Unity, which has become my favorite engine and the one I feel more comfortable working on, but I also tried Godot and Unreal. In this page you can see a summary of my work or play some of my games in my [**Itch**](https://salmon64.itch.io/) profile.

### Project KOE

[Project KOE](https://salmon64.itch.io/project-koe) is the most ambicious game I've worked on, is a 2D platformer with gameplay inspired by Super Meat Boy and graphics inspired by Hollow Knight. I made this game and its assets all by myself with the exceptions of the sound effects and music (wich I have license to use  them).

For this I used the following tools:
* Unity 2020.1f
* Krita for draw all the sprites, textures, normal maps and tilesets.
* Sonniss.com - GDC - Game Audio Bundles.
* Audacity for edit some audio effects.
* C#
* Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2019 Community.
* Json.NET

A playable demo is available for Windows and Linux, it features: 
* 6 levels which gives the demo an aproximate lenght of 40 minutes.
* It can be played in english or spanish.
* Pulished graphics with some cool shaders and parallax scrolling for sense of depth.
* Sound effects and a music track for the levels.
* Game saves your progress using JSON serialization.

If you want see the game running you can watch this [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8lvnrH_Es) or download it [here.](https://salmon64.itch.io/project-koe)

### 3D Tilemap Generator.
A tool I'm working on for creating 3D tilemaps in unity using heightmaps.

### Beginner 3D models I have made using blender.
Yeah they are not too fancy, Im more a programmer than an artist, but I put it here anyway.

## Preg√∫ntame.

I've worked in this program for about 2 months before de 1.0 release. It is on my plans to keep working in it. I want it to be a useful tool for students that are preparing for exams in the multiple choice format, at the moment the software is written in spanish and documentation too because its main goal is to help students that have to do admision test for M√©xico Universities, but I want to translate everything to english.
Software randomly takes questions contained in .txt files with a specified format and choses wrong and rights answers, the user has to select the right answer. Software allows to:
* Multiple right answers per question.
* Tagging questions.
* Include images with questions and answers.

You can check it out [**here.**](https://github.com/salMonLaferte/Preguntame)
It is written in C# and uses WPF for the user interface.
